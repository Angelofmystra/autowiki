<h2>Armour Types</h2>
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Infantry Low</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typically used by builders, with a few notable exceptions.</li>
<li>Anti-Tank weapons are often effective against it</li>
<li>Certain Jumper units do less ranged damage to it.</li>
<li>Jumper squad leaders often improve the squad's ability to kill builders</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Building Low</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typically used by Listening Posts and Power Generators</li>
<li>In other words, knowing what units are effective against building_low helps with destroying the enemy's economy.</li>
<li>Flamers do enhanced damage against them. However, they have low range. This promotes tactical risk vs reward.</li>
<li>Many units do better in melee against building_low than using ranged. This further promotes tactical risk vs reward.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Heavy Infantry Medium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weak against plasma weapons</li>
<li>Also known as Space Marine Armour</li>
<li>Many races have access to this armour type</li>
<li>Resistant to heavy bolters, though other armour types provide better protection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heavy Infantry Low</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typically used by Tau. Kasrkin also use it.</li>
<li>Typically weaker in melee, compared to Heavy Infantry Medium</li>
<li>Superior protection against Heavy Bolters</li>
<li>Superior protection against area of effect spells</li>
<li>Like Heavy Infantry Medium, this armour type is weak against plasma weapons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heavy Infantry High</h3>
<ul>
<li>Also known as Terminator armour</li>
<li>Resistant to plasma weapons, compared to Heavy Infantry Low and Medium</li>
<li>Often units with this armour type morale break before they die</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Vehicle_High</h3>

<li>Even more resistant to anti-tank weapons</li>
<li>Commanders often do enhanced damage in melee to them</li>
<li>With the larger vehicle_high units, it is often best to stun them with various forms of EMP and then trap them with dreadnoughts or other uber melee units</li>
</ul>
