# Dowpro Autowiki

## Description of project

Python scripts which generate an autowiki - an auto updating wikipedia (serving as a learning tool and documentation) for the dowpro (dawn of war pro) mod. 

## Name of all libraries

No libraries are used. Only python.

## Brief history

There used to exist an autowiki for dowpro. However, the scripts were lost in time. Now we need a new autowiki. This repo serves as the go to place for the scripts and on-going development.

## Set up instructions

You will need to copy the python scripts to the appropriate directory. The python script assumes a specific current workig directory - as that is needed for folder parsing.
